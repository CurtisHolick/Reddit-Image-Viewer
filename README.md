# Reddit-Image-Viewer
An application I made using python Tkinter to pull images from subreddits to browse. I created this in 2018, before I had taken programming classes.

Required Packages:
-
- Tkinter
- Praw
- PIL
- Requests

Also requires a file `Reddit account info.txt` which contains the following information for the Praw api (in order):
- Reddit Username
- Reddit Password
- Reddit Client Id
- Reddit Client Secret
- Reddit User Agent
